# Connection-service

 This service provides a very simple flask based
server to serve connection information to DAQ applications.


## REST interface

  The server reponds to the following uris

### /publish
 Allows publication of connection information. The content of the
 request should be JSON encoded. For example, the following json file
 can be published using curl.

```
> cat publish.json
{
 "connections":[
  {
   "connection_type":0,
   "data_type":"TPSet",
   "uid":"DRO-000-tp_to_trigger",
   "uri":"tcp://192.168.1.100:1234"
  },
  {
   "connection_type":0,
   "data_type":"TPSet",
   "uid":"DRO-001-tp_to_trigger",
   "uri":"tcp://192.168.1.100:1235"
  }
 ],
 "partition":"ccTest"
}

> curl -d @publish.json -H "content-type: application/json" \
    http://connection-flask.connections:5000/publish
```

### /getconnection/<partition> 
This uri returns a list of connections matching the 'uid_regex' and
'data_type' specified in the JSON encoded request.

```
curl -d '{"uid_regex":"DRO.*","data_type":"TPSet"}' \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
     http://connection-flask.connections:5000/getconnection/ccTest
[{"uid": "DRO-000-tp_to_trigger", "uri": "tcp://192.168.1.100:1234", "connection_type": 0, "data_type": "TPSet"}, {"uid": "DRO-001-tp_to_trigger", "uri": "tcp://192.168.1.100:1235", "connection_type": 0, "data_type": "TPSet"}]
```


### /retract
This uri should be used to remove published connections. The request should be JSON encoded with the keys "partition" and "connections" with the latter being an array of "connection_id" and "data_type" values.


### /retract-partition
This uri should be used to remove all published connections from the
given partition. The request should be a urlencoded form with one field "partition" naming the partition to be retracted.

## Running the server locally from the command line
 The server is intended to be run under the Gunicorn web server.
 
 ```
 gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers=1 --worker-class=gthread --threads=2 \
        --timeout 5000000000 connection-service.connection-flask:app
 ```

Some debug information will be printed by the connection-flask if the
environment variable 'CONNECTION_FLASK_DEBUG' is set to a number
greater than 0. Currently 1 will print timing information for the
publish/lookup calls. 2 will give information about what was
published/looked up and 3 is even more verbose printing the actual
JSON of the requests.
